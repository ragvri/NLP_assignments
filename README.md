# NLP assignments

This repository contains the solution to my NLP coursework.

A brief description of different problems is as follows:

**Problem 1: NER)** In this problem, we have to develop models which can be deployed for Named Entity Recognition. We built 2 models: one using Hidden Markov Model and other using Neural Networks. The results and the performance comparison of the 2 models can be found in the readme of the folder

**Problem 2: POS)** Same assignment as the previous one except the problem is now to POS tag a given sentence, again comparing the performace of HMM and Neural Networks.

**Problem 3: Sense Embeddings)** This assignment involved using WordNet and word embeddings in order to find the most similar words.

*Details of each assignment can be found in there respective folders*
